## ü™¥ About Me

As a freelance web designer and developer, I am passionate about creating innovative solutions and delivering high-quality websites. With a strong background in both front-end and back-end development, I strive to solve complex problems and provide efficient, user-friendly experiences. I have successfully completed diverse projects, including web applications, RESTful APIs, and database management.

## üåü My Background

In the early years of my career, I primarily focused on front-end development and utilized my skills to make updates for the restaurant groups I worked for. This involved tasks such as modifying opening hours, updating photos, and managing menus. I gained valuable experience in working with real-world clients and understanding their specific needs.

In June 2021, I decided to take on a side hustle and started building static websites for local small businesses. This allowed me to further expand my skills and gain practical experience in developing sites from scratch. I dedicated my free time to crafting visually appealing and functional websites for my clients.

As I progressed in my career, I realized the importance of rounding out my skill set and gaining a deeper understanding of back-end development. To achieve this, I made the decision to enroll in a program that included comprehensive training in both front-end and back-end development. This experience provided me with the knowledge and hands-on practice needed to become a well-rounded web professional.
